# Plan Environment Setup

Set up the development environment and configuration:

1. Read `docs/product_spec.md` for third-party services needed
2. Read `docs/architecture.md` for tech stack and infrastructure details
3. Identify all environment variables and external services required
4. Ask me about:
   - Which services I already have accounts for
   - Any existing API keys or credentials to reuse
   - Local development preferences (ports, tools)
   - Environment tiers needed (dev, staging, prod)
5. After I answer, create/update:
   - `.env.example`, `.env.local`, and `.env` with all required variables (no secrets)
   - `README.md` setup instructions if needed
   - Any config files for third-party services
   - Document the setup process in architecture or a separate guide
   - Confirm what I need to update myself

Start with step 1. Ask questions before creating files.
