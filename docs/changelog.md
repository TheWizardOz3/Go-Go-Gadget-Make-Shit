## [0.26.0] - 2026-01-19

### Summary
**Cloud-Based Scheduled Prompts & Edit Functionality** - Scheduled prompts can now run even when your laptop is offline via Modal cloud. Also added the ability to edit existing scheduled prompts.

### Added
- **Cloud Scheduled Prompts** - Prompts are synced to Modal and executed by a cron job every 30 minutes
  - `POST /api/scheduled-prompts/sync` endpoint in Modal for receiving prompt sync
  - Modal Dict storage (`gogogadget-scheduled-prompts`) for persistent prompt data
  - `check_scheduled_prompts()` cron function with `@modal.Cron("*/30 * * * *")` decorator
  - Automatic ntfy notifications when cloud prompts complete
  - Prompts enriched with `gitRemoteUrl` and `projectName` for cloud execution
- **Edit Scheduled Prompts** - Click any prompt in the list to edit it
  - Edit button (pencil icon) on each prompt row
  - Row is clickable to open edit form
  - Reuses existing creation form with pre-filled values
  - `updatePrompt()` function in useScheduledPrompts hook
- **Automatic Cloud Sync** - Local changes automatically sync to Modal in background
  - `scheduledPromptsSyncService.ts` handles enrichment and sync
  - `triggerCloudSync()` called after create, update, delete, toggle operations

### Changed
- **Scheduled Prompts: Manual Run Endpoint** - `POST /api/scheduled-prompts/:id/run` to manually execute a scheduled prompt immediately
- **Scheduled Prompts: Missed Detection** - `GET /api/scheduled-prompts/status/missed` endpoint for checking missed prompts

### Fixed
- **Scheduled Prompts: Missed Prompt Visibility** - Server detects and warns about prompts missed due to downtime

---

## [0.25.0] - 2026-01-19

### Summary
**Image Attachments** - Attach a screenshot or image to your prompts for visual context. Works in both local and cloud (Modal) execution modes.

### Added
- **Attach button** in PromptInput — Tap to select an image (PNG, JPG, WebP)
- **Image preview** with remove button before sending
- **Local mode support** — Image saved to temp file, referenced via `@filepath` in prompt
- **Cloud mode support** — Image sent as base64 to Modal, processed the same way
- **5MB file size limit** enforced on client

### Technical Details
- `ImageAttachment` type added to shared types
- `claudeService.ts` saves base64 to `/tmp/gogogadget-<uuid>.png`, prepends `@path` to prompt
- Modal `execute_prompt` handles `image_attachment` parameter identically
- Temp files cleaned up after Claude process exits

### Files Changed
- `shared/types/index.ts` — New `ImageAttachment` interface
- `server/src/api/sessions.ts` — Accept `imageAttachment` in send prompt

## [0.24.0] - 2026-01-18

### Summary
**Persistent Repo Volumes** - Major architectural improvement to cloud execution. Git repositories now persist in a Modal Volume across container restarts, eliminating re-cloning on every prompt. Changes are no longer auto-pushed; users explicitly push when ready.

### Added
- **Persistent repos volume** (`gogogadget-repos`) - Stores cloned git repos in Modal Volume
  - First prompt for a project clones the repo once
  - Subsequent prompts reuse existing repo (fast!)
  - Changes accumulate across multiple prompts in same session
- **Explicit push endpoint** (`POST /api/cloud/push`) - User controls when changes go to GitHub
  - No more auto-push after every prompt
  - Review changes before pushing
  - Safer for iterative development
- **Check changes endpoint** (`POST /api/cloud/changes`) - View pending uncommitted/unpushed changes
  - Shows uncommitted files, unpushed commits, diff summary
- **Cloud Repo Banner component** - UI for managing pending changes
  - Shows count of unpushed commits
  - Expandable details with commit list and diff
  - "Push to GitHub" button with loading state
- **`useCloudRepo` hook** - Client-side hook for cloud repo operations
  - `checkChanges(projectName)` - Check for pending changes
  - `pushChanges(projectName, repoUrl)` - Explicit push

### Changed
- **execute_prompt no longer auto-pushes** - Commits locally but doesn't push
- **Repos volume mounted at `/repos`** instead of ephemeral `/tmp/repos`
- **New sessions pull latest from origin** - Ensures fresh start
- **Session continuation preserves local changes** - No `git pull` when continuing

### Architecture
- Two Modal Volumes now: `gogogadget-sessions` (JSONL) + `gogogadget-repos` (git repos)
- Modal function `execute_prompt` mounts both volumes
- New Modal functions: `check_repo_changes`, `push_repo_changes`

### Developer Notes
- Deploy with `modal deploy modal/modal_app.py`
- Volumes are automatically created on first deploy
- GitHub token (PAT) required in Modal secrets for private repos

---

## [0.23.0] - 2026-01-18

### Summary
**Cloud Mode Polish** - Major refinements to cloud execution: session continuation, ntfy notifications, file tree caching, debug logging, and improved UI/UX.

### Added
- **Cloud session continuation** - Send messages to existing cloud sessions instead of creating new ones every time
  - Pass `sessionId` to Modal jobs for continuing conversations
  - Modal uses `claude -p "prompt" --continue <session-id>` when resuming
- **ntfy notifications from cloud** - Receive push notifications when cloud tasks complete
  - `ntfyTopic` parameter passed from client settings to Modal
  - Modal sends ntfy.sh notification with success/failure emoji
- **Cloud job pending UI** - Loading animation while cloud jobs execute
  - Shows stages: "Job queued" → "Cloning repository" → "Claude is thinking"
  - Elapsed timer and progress bar
  - Polls `/api/cloud/jobs/{id}` for status updates
- **Persistent debug logging** - Client-side logs stored in `localStorage` for offline debugging
  - `debugLog.ts` utility with info/warn/error levels
  - Settings UI section to view, refresh, copy, and clear logs
  - Logs API requests, responses, and mode changes
- **File tree caching** - Cached file trees for offline viewing in cloud mode
  - `useFileTree` uses cached data as `fallbackData` in SWR
  - File content also cached for faster navigation
- **Connection mode badge** - Shows "Local" or "Cloud" in header with tap-to-refresh

### Changed
- **Unified UI for local/cloud modes** - Same experience regardless of connection
  - All prompts, voice input, and file viewing work identically
  - Settings stored in `localStorage` when in cloud mode (Modal doesn't persist)
- **Cloud sessions endpoint** - `/api/cloud/sessions` now scans Modal volume for actual session files
- **Modal transcription endpoint** - Added `/api/transcribe` for voice input in cloud mode
  - Uses Groq Whisper API via `httpx`
  - Requires `GROQ_API_KEY` Modal secret
- **Improved error feedback** - Clear toast messages for cloud execution failures
- **Simplified serverless settings UI** - Removed direct token inputs (use Modal secrets instead)

### Fixed
- **Cloud mode prompts not working** - Multiple endpoint and path fixes
- **Voice transcription in cloud** - Added filename to audio upload for Groq compatibility
- **"Error" badge in header** - Corrected `getApiMode()` usage across hooks
- **Modal URL newline character** - Added `.trim()` to environment variable parsing
- **Project path mismatch** - Cloud sessions stored under `/tmp/repos/{name}`, client now queries correctly
- **Test failures** - Added `getApiMode` mock to `useSettings.test.ts`

### Technical Notes
- Modal now uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret for private repo cloning in `execute_prompt`
- Added `requests` dependency to Modal image for webhook notifications
- Made `projectPath` optional in `/api/sessions/{id}/messages` endpoint

### Version Tags
