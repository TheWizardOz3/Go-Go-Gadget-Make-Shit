# Test

Test the **[FEATURE/COMPONENT]** we just built:

1. Read `docs/Features/[feature-name].md`
2. Identify what tests should exist for the overall feature (unit, integration, e2e)
3. Run existing tests to verify nothing broke
4. Write new tests for the new functionality
5. Use browser tools to manually verify UI if applicable (avoid actions which will invoke APIs that cost money like LLMs or scrapers, ask before doing so if you absolutely need to test those)
6. Report results (do not commit to git or update any docs. Use explicit confirmation like "Testing complete with 0 errors. Ready to finalize?").

Start with step 1.
