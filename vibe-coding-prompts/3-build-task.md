# Build Task

Implement the next task, task **[TASK NUMBER]** for the feature **[FEATURE NAME]**: **[TASK DESCRIPTION]**

1. Read `docs/Features/[feature-name].md` for the feature you're working on, and any other relevant feature docs
2. Implement the next incomplete task in the feature. Follow existing patterns in the codebase and keep changes minimal and focused.
3. Run linting after implementation. Don't worry about unit tests for now, those will come as part of a bigger testing step for the overall feature later.
4. Confirm when complete.  If there are tasks remaining, call the /build-task slash command. If this was the final task in the feature, or if blockers arise, confirm when complete using explicit confirmation like "Task **[TASK NUMBER OUT OF TOTAL TASKS IN FEATURE NUMBER]** complete. Ready for next task, or do you want to test this first?".

Start with step 1.
